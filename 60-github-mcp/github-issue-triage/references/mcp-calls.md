# GitHub MCP call guide (issue triage)

## Common calls
- List issues by filters (state, label, milestone, author)
- Get issue details and comments
- Search issues by keyword or error signature
- Add or remove labels
- Assign or unassign users
- Create comments with info requests
- Close or reopen issues

## Safety
- Reuse existing labels and milestones
- Do not close issues without explicit policy
