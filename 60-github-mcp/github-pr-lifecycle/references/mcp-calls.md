# GitHub MCP call guide (PR lifecycle)

## Common calls
- List or search PRs
- Create or update a PR
- Request reviewers or teams
- Read checks/status for a PR
- Merge PR with the approved strategy

## Safety
- Do not merge without required checks and approvals
- Avoid switching base branches without explicit instruction
