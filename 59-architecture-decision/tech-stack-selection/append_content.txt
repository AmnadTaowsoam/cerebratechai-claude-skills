## Best Practices

### Technology Selection Best Practices
- **Start with Requirements**: Begin with clear requirements before evaluating technologies. Document functional, non-functional, and technical requirements. This prevents scope creep and ensures you select the right tool for the job.
- **Use a Framework**: Establish a consistent evaluation framework with weighted criteria. This ensures objective decisions and reduces bias.
- **Involve the Team**: Include stakeholders from engineering, product, and operations. Diverse perspectives lead to better decisions.
- **Consider Total Cost of Ownership**: Evaluate not just initial costs but long-term costs including maintenance, training, hiring, and infrastructure.
- **Prototype Before Commiting**: Build small proof-of-concept projects before making final decisions. This validates assumptions and reduces risk.
- **Document the Decision**: Create an ADR (Architecture Decision Record) for every significant technology choice. This provides historical context and rationale.

### Evaluation Framework Best Practices
- **Define Weighted Criteria**: Assign weights to criteria based on project needs (e.g., performance = 30%, team expertise = 25%, cost = 20%, ecosystem = 15%, long-term viability = 10%).
- **Score Options Objectively**: Use a scoring matrix to evaluate each option against criteria. Calculate weighted scores for objective comparison.
- **Set Minimum Thresholds**: Define minimum scores for each criterion. Options below threshold are disqualified.
- **Use Quantitative Data**: Gather data on performance benchmarks, developer availability, hiring costs, and ecosystem maturity. This supports data-driven decisions.
- **Consider Qualitative Factors**: Include team morale, learning curve, and vendor stability. These can be harder to measure but are important.

### Proof of Concept Best Practices
- **Keep it Small**: Build minimal viable products (MVPs) that demonstrate key capabilities. This reduces time and cost.
- **Use Real Data**: Prototype with realistic data volumes and user scenarios. This reveals real performance characteristics.
- **Measure Key Metrics**: Track the metrics that matter for your use case (response time, throughput, memory usage, developer productivity).
- **Set Success Criteria**: Define what constitutes a successful PoC before starting. This prevents scope creep and ensures objective evaluation.
- **Time-Box the Evaluation**: Set a strict time limit for evaluation (e.g., 2 weeks). This prevents analysis paralysis.

### Team Expertise Best Practices
- **Leverage Existing Skills**: Choose technologies your team already knows. This reduces learning curve and improves velocity.
- **Hiring Considerations**: If you need to hire, factor in availability of developers and training costs. This should be part of your TCO calculation.
- **Training Budget**: Allocate time and budget for training if choosing unfamiliar technologies. This is often overlooked but critical for success.
- **Cross-Polling**: Get input from multiple team members to avoid individual bias. This leads to better, more balanced decisions.
- **Document Assumptions**: If you're assuming your team can learn a technology, document this risk and mitigation plan.

### Ecosystem and Community Best Practices
- **Evaluate Community Health**: Look at GitHub stars, npm downloads, Stack Overflow activity, and security advisories. Healthy ecosystems are safer long-term investments.
- **Check Vendor Stability**: Consider the company behind the technology. Is it well-funded? Are they responsive to issues?
- **Assess Library Maturity**: Evaluate the maturity of the ecosystem. Are there established patterns, tools, and best practices?
- **Consider Integration Options**: How well does this integrate with your existing stack? Are there official SDKs or libraries?
- **Look for Alternatives**: Don't limit yourself to the first option. A healthier ecosystem provides more options and leverage.

### Long-term Viability Best Practices
- **Technology Lifecycle**: Consider where the technology is in its lifecycle. New technologies are risky; mature technologies are stable but may become obsolete.
- **Exit Strategy**: Plan your exit strategy before committing. What happens if the technology doesn't work out? Can we migrate away easily?
- **Vendor Lock-in Risk**: Evaluate the risk of vendor lock-in. Can you switch vendors if needed? Are there open-source alternatives?
- **Talent Availability**: Consider the availability of developers with this skill set. Can you hire replacements easily if team members leave?
- **Platform Dependencies**: What platform dependencies does this create? Are you comfortable with these dependencies long-term?

### Cost Analysis Best Practices
- **Total Cost of Ownership**: Calculate TCO including:
  - Initial development time
  - Ongoing maintenance
- Infrastructure costs (servers, databases, third-party services)
- Training and hiring
  - Support and troubleshooting
  - Migration costs (if switching)
- **Compare Apples to Apples**: Don't compare open-source with commercial. Compare total TCO including all factors above.
- **Consider Economies of Scale**: Consider how costs change at scale. Some technologies scale better (cloud-native), others get expensive quickly.
- **Budget for Uncertainty**: Include a buffer for unexpected costs (15-20% is typical for technology projects).

### Performance Best Practices
- **Benchmark Early**: Establish performance benchmarks early and measure against them during evaluation. This prevents surprises after commit.
- **Consider Real-World Scenarios**: Look for case studies and benchmarks from companies with similar scale and requirements.
- **Profile Before Optimizing**: Don't optimize prematurely. Profile first to identify actual bottlenecks, then optimize.
- **Consider Hardware Requirements**: Evaluate hardware requirements (CPU, memory, storage) and factor into cost analysis.
- **Load Test**: Include load testing in your PoC to understand performance under realistic conditions.

### Security Best Practices
- **Security Track Record**: Research the security history of the technology. Have there been major vulnerabilities? How quickly are patches released?
- **Default Security Settings**: Evaluate default security configurations. Are they secure by default or require hardening?
- **Compliance Requirements**: Consider if the technology meets your compliance requirements (SOC2, HIPAA, PCI DSS, GDPR).
- **Encryption Support**: Does the technology support encryption at rest and in transit? Is it easy to implement?
- **Audit Capabilities**: Does the technology provide audit logging and monitoring out of the box?

### Migration and Integration Best Practices
- **Migration Path**: Consider migration costs if you need to switch technologies later. Some migrations are easier than others.
- **Integration Complexity**: How well does this integrate with your existing systems? Consider APIs, SDKs, and data formats.
- **Data Migration**: How will you migrate existing data? Consider tools, scripts, and downtime requirements.
- **Rollback Strategy**: Plan your rollback strategy. Can you quickly revert if the new technology doesn't work out?
- **Parallel Run**: Consider running old and new systems in parallel during migration. This reduces risk and enables gradual cutover.
- **Testing Requirements**: What testing is required? Integration tests, performance tests, end-to-end tests?
