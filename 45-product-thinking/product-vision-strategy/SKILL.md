# Product Vision and Strategy

## Overview

Product Vision is the "Why" behind the product—the aspirational future state it aims to create. Product Strategy is the "How"—the high-level plan that bridges the gap between the vision and the roadmap through choices about target markets, unique value propositions, and business goals.

**Core Principle**: "Strategy is as much about deciding what NOT to do as it is about what to do."

## 1. The Product Vision Statement

A great vision statement is inspiring, concise, and stable over time (3-5 years).

### Example Framework (Geoffrey Moore):
*   **For** [target customer]
*   **Who** [statement of need or opportunity]
*   **The** [product name] is a [product category]
*   **That** [key benefit / reason to buy]
*   **Unlike** [primary competitive alternative]
*   **Our product** [statement of primary differentiation]

### Famous Example: Amazon
*"Our vision is to be earth's most customer-centric company; to build a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online."*

## 2. Competitive Strategy: Porter's Five Forces

Understanding the market dynamics before choosing a strategy:

1.  **Competitive Rivalry**: How many competitors exist?
2.  **Supplier Power**: How easy is it for suppliers to drive up prices?
3.  **Buyer Power**: How much power do customers have to drive down prices?
4.  **Threat of Substitution**: How likely are customers to find a different way of doing what you do?
5.  **Threat of New Entry**: How high are the barriers to entry?

## 3. Product Strategy: The DHM Model (Gibson Biddle)

A strategy must answer three questions:
1.  **D**elight: How will the product delight customers? (e.g., Personalization, convenience).
2.  **H**ard to Copy: What is the "moat" that stops competitors? (e.g., Network effects, unique tech, brand).
3.  **M**argin-Enhancing: How will it make money? (e.g., Subscription, transaction fees, advertising).

---

## 4. Market Positioning and Segmenting

Don't build for everyone. Build for a specific segment.

*   **TAM (Total Addressable Market)**: Everyone who could use your product globally.
*   **SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)**: Those you can actually reach (e.g., North American Enterprise).
*   **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)**: The narrow group you will target *this year*.

## 5. Strategic Frameworks

### A. SWOT Analysis
Useful for internal self-assessment.
*   **S**trengths (Internal, Positive)
*   **W**eaknesses (Internal, Negative)
*   **O**pportunities (External, Positive)
*   **T**hreats (External, Negative)

### B. The Blue Ocean Strategy
Creating an uncontested market space ("Blue Ocean") instead of competing in an overcrowded market ("Red Ocean"). Focus on **Eliminating**, **Reducing**, **Raising**, and **Creating** features relative to the industry standard.

## 6. The Product Strategy Document

A comprehensive strategy includes:
1.  **Vision Statement**: The North Star.
2.  **Strategic Pillars**: 3-5 high-level focus areas (e.g., "AI-First Automation," "Enterprise Security").
3.  **Success Metrics**: How will we know the strategy is working? (e.g., "50% reduction in manual effort").
4.  **Assumptions & Risks**: What must be true for this to succeed?
5.  **Non-Goals**: What are we explicitly *not* doing?

---

## 7. Strategy vs. Roadmap

| Feature | Strategy | Roadmap |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Focus** | Outcome-oriented (The "What" and "Why"). | Output-oriented (The "When"). |
| **View** | High-level, abstract. | Specific features and dates. |
| **Flexibility**| Stable (Updated quarterly/annually). | Dynamic (Updated monthly/bi-weekly). |

## 8. Real-World Scenario: Netflix's Move to Streaming
*   **The Vision**: Instant access to movies and TV shows everywhere.
*   **The Strategy (2007)**: Cannibalize the DVD-by-mail business to invest in streaming technology.
*   **Risk**: Licensing costs were high, and internet speeds were slow.
*   **Outcome**: By being "first and fast," they built a massive network effect and proprietary recommendation engine that became "Hard to Copy."

## 9. Product Vision and Strategy Checklist

- [ ] **Inspiring**: Does the vision statement motivate the team?
- [ ] **Choices**: Does the strategy make clear trade-offs (Choosing A over B)?
- [ ] **Differentiation**: Is it clear why a customer would pick us over a competitor?
- [ ] **Feasibility**: Do we have the technical resources to achieve the vision?
- [ ] **Alignment**: Does the design team and engineering team agree on the strategy?
- [ ] **Measurability**: Can we measure progress toward the vision?
