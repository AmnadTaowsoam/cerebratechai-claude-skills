# Stakeholder Management

## Overview

Stakeholder Management is the art and science of identifying the people who influence or are influenced by your product and ensuring their needs are balanced with the product strategy. In technical projects, failure is often caused by mismatched expectations, not just code bugs.

**Core Principle**: "Manage expectations early and often. No one likes surprises."

## 1. Stakeholder Mapping (Power/Interest Matrix)

Not every stakeholder requires the same amount of attention.

| Influence (Power) | High Interest | Low Interest |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High** | **Manage Closely**: (CEO, Lead Engineer, Key Customer). Requires high-touch, frequent updates. | **Keep Satisfied**: (Legal, Security, Finance). Ensure their criteria are met. |
| **Low** | **Keep Informed**: (Sales, Marketing, Support). Provide regular newsletters or digests. | **Monitor**: (Occasional users, indirect teams). Minimal effort/info. |

## 2. The RACI Matrix

Define clear responsibilities for every major project or roadmap item.

*   **R**esponsible: Person who does the work.
*   **A**ccountable: Person who "owns" the outcome (Usually the Product Manager).
*   **C**onsulted: People asked for advice/input (Subject Matter Experts).
*   **I**nformed: People told about progress/decisions.

## 3. Communication Strategies by Stakeholder Type

| Stakeholder | Goal | Channel | Style |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Executive**| Alignment on strategy/ROI.| Quarterly Review / Slack. | High-level, data-driven, concise. |
| **Engineering**| Clarity on "How" and "Why".| Sprint Planning / Slack. | Technical, detailed, open to feedback. |
| **Sales** | Feature availability/Dates. | Monthly Roadmap Webinar. | Value-focused, realistic, supportive. |
| **Support** | Bug fixes / UX changes. | Documentation / Release Notes. | Practical, "how-to" focused. |

## 4. Mastery of the "No"

A Product Manager must say "No" to 90% of requests to keep the "Now" focused on quality and strategy.

### The "No" Sandwich
1.  **Positive**: Validate the idea. "I really see why that feature would help [Customer Group]."
2.  **The No**: Be honest about the trade-off. "However, looking at our current North Star, adding this now would delay [Critical Feature] by 2 months."
3.  **Alternative**: "I'm adding this to our 'Later' list for discovery next quarter."

## 5. Identifying and Managing "HiPPOs"

**HiPPO**: **Hi**ghest **P**aid **P**erson's **O**pinion.

**Strategy**: Pivot from "Opinions" to "Evidence."
*   *Bad Response*: "I don't think that will work."
*   *Better Response*: "That's an interesting hypothesis. Let's run a quick discovery test and look at the data before we commit the engineering team to building it."

---

## 6. Building Trust and Credibility

1.  **Transparency**: Share the "Why" behind prioritization. Show the RICE scores.
2.  **Consistency**: Follow through on what you say you will do in the "Now" tier.
3.  **Empathy**: Understand *why* a stakeholder is asking for something (e.g., Sales is under pressure to hit a quota).
4.  **No Blame**: If a feature fails or a bug hits, own the outcome rather than blaming the engineering team.

---

## 7. The Product Presentation Framework

When presenting a feature or strategy:
1.  **The Context**: What problem are we solving?
2.  **The Evidence**: What data or research proves this is a problem?
3.  **The Proposal**: What is the feature/strategy?
4.  **The Impact**: What metric will it move?
5.  **The Trade-off**: What are we *not* doing instead?

---

## 8. Real-World Scenario: The "Emergency" Integration
*   **Scenario**: Sales promised a custom integration to close a major deal without consulting Product.
*   **Management**:
    - **Identify**: Sales is the stakeholder.
    - **Action**: Held a meeting to show the current Sprint Backlog.
    - **Resolution**: Instead of refusing, negotiated a "Hybrid" approach where a 3rd-party tool (Zapier) was used mid-term to fulfill the contract, keeping the core engineering team focused on the roadmap.
*   **Outcome**: Customer was happy, deal closed, and the roadmap stayed on track.

## 9. Stakeholder Management Checklist

- [ ] **Mapping**: Have we categorized our stakeholders by Power and Interest?
- [ ] **RACI**: Is it clear who is Accountable vs. who is just being Informed?
- [ ] **Cadence**: Do we have regular (Weekly/Monthly) touchpoints with high-power stakeholders?
- [ ] **Evidence-based**: Are we using data to challenge opinions?
- [ ] **Feedback Loop**: Have we closed the loop with every stakeholder who submitted a feature request?
- [ ] **No-surprises**: Have stakeholders been informed of any delays *before* the deadline?
- [ ] **Culture**: Are we fostering a collaborative "Team" environment rather than an "Us vs. Them" one?
