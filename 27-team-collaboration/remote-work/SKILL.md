## Anti-patterns

### ❌ Don't: Always Sync

```markdown
# ❌ Bad - Everything requires sync meeting
"Let's schedule a meeting to discuss"
# Blocks progress!
```

```markdown
# ✅ Good - Async first
"Documented decision in Notion, review by EOD"
# Non-blocking
```

### ❌ Don't: No Boundaries

```markdown
# ❌ Bad - Always available
Slack: "Can you help?" at 11 PM
# Burnout!
```

```markdown
# ✅ Good - Clear boundaries
Working hours: 9 AM - 6 PM
Do Not Disturb: After hours
# Healthy boundaries
```
