## Best Practices

### Metrics Selection
- [ ] Monitor all four core health metrics
- [ ] Use appropriate thresholds for your infrastructure
- [ ] Monitor engine-specific metrics
- [ ] Track resource utilization trends
- [ ] Monitor query performance

- [ ]

### Alerting
- [ ] Set up PagerDuty for critical alerts
- [ ] Configure Slack for non-critical alerts
- [ ] Use email for low-priority alerts
- [ ] Set up on-call rotation
- [ ] Define alert escalation procedures
- [ ] Configure alert aggregation to reduce noise
- [ ] Set up alert suppression for known maintenance
- [ ] Test alert delivery mechanisms
- [ ] Document alert thresholds
- [ ] Use appropriate alert severity levels
- [ ]

### Monitoring Tools
- [ ] Use Datadog for full-stack monitoring

- [ ] Use Grafana for dashboards
- [ ] Use Percona PMM for database metrics
- [ ] Use AWS CloudWatch for cloud infrastructure
- [ ] Use New Relic for APM
- [ ] Use native database monitoring tools
- [ ] Use pg_stat_statements for PostgreSQL
- [ ] Use Performance Schema for MySQL
- [ ] Use Redis INFO for Redis metrics
- [ ] Use MongoDB Atlas for cloud monitoring
- [ ] Use database-native monitoring solutions
- [ ]

### Performance Tuning
- [ ] Regularly review and optimize slow queries
- [ ] Create appropriate indexes for query patterns
- [ ] Update table statistics regularly
- [ ] Monitor and optimize connection pool settings
- [ ] Use query execution plans
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Optimize database configuration parameters
- [ ] Use read replicas for reporting workloads
- [ ] Partition large tables for better performance
- [ ] Use appropriate data types for columns
- [ ] Normalize database schema to reduce redundancy
- [ ] Monitor and optimize autovacuum settings
- [ ] Use connection keepalive settings
- [ ] Optimize WAL configuration
- [ ]

### Backup and Recovery
- [ ] Implement automated backup schedules
- [ ] Test backup restoration procedures regularly
- [ ] Monitor backup job success/failure
- [ ] Use point-in-time recovery for critical databases
- [ ] Implement backup verification
- [ ] Store backups in separate location
- [ ] Use appropriate backup retention policies
- [ ] Document backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Test failover procedures
- [ ] Monitor backup storage costs
- [ ]

### Security
- [ ] Enable database authentication
- [ ] Use SSL/TLS for all connections
- [ ] Implement network-level firewalls
- [ ] Use least-privilege database accounts
- [ ] Encrypt backups at rest
- [ ] Rotate encryption keys regularly
- [ ] Monitor for unauthorized access attempts
- [ ] Implement audit logging for database operations
- [ ] Use VPC isolation for sensitive databases
- [ ] Follow principle of least privilege
- [ ] Regularly update database software
- [ ] Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- [ ] Implement connection rate limiting
- [ ] Monitor for security vulnerabilities
- [ ]

### Capacity Planning
- [ ] Monitor storage growth trends
- [ ] Plan for capacity upgrades
- [ ] Monitor connection pool utilization
- [ ] Set up scaling alerts
- [ ] Use auto-scaling for cloud databases
- [ ] Plan for peak load scenarios
- [ ] Monitor IOPS and throughput requirements
- [ ] Document capacity planning procedures
- [ ] Regular capacity reviews
- [ ]

### Documentation
- [ ] Document all monitoring setup procedures
- [ ] Document alert thresholds and responses
- [ ] Maintain runbook for common issues
- [ ] Document database architecture
- [ ] Document backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Document performance tuning guidelines
- [ ] Document security configurations
- [ ] Share knowledge with team
- [ ]

### Testing
- [ ] Test monitoring in staging environment first
- [ ] Simulate failure scenarios
- [ ] Test alert delivery mechanisms
- [ ] Test backup restoration procedures
- [ ] Test failover procedures
- [ ] Load test monitoring infrastructure
- [ ] Test with production-like data volumes
- [ ] Validate monitoring queries
- [ ]
