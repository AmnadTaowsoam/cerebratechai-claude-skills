# Proposal, SOW & Delivery Management

## Overview

Professional services delivery encompasses writing proposals, defining scope of work (SOW), managing client expectations, and delivering projects successfully. Essential skills for consultants, agencies, and freelancers.

## Why This Matters

- **Win rate**: Clear proposals win more business
- **Scope control**: SOW prevents scope creep
- **Client satisfaction**: Managed expectations = happy clients
- **Profitability**: Accurate scoping = profitable projects

## Proposal Writing

### Proposal Structure

```markdown
1. Executive Summary
   - Problem statement
   - Proposed solution
   - Expected outcomes
   - Investment required

2. Understanding of Requirements
   - Client's challenges
   - Current state
   - Desired future state

3. Proposed Solution
   - Approach and methodology
   - Deliverables
   - Timeline
   - Team composition

4. Why Us
   - Relevant experience
   - Case studies
   - Team credentials
   - Differentiators

5. Investment
   - Pricing breakdown
   - Payment terms
   - Assumptions

6. Next Steps

```

### Winning Proposal Tips

```
✓ Address client's pain points specifically
✓ Show you understand their business
✓ Provide concrete examples (case studies)
✓ Be clear about what's included/excluded
✓ Make pricing transparent
✓ Include social proof (testimonials)

✗ Generic, template-heavy proposals
✗ Focus only on features, not benefits
✗ Vague deliverables
✗ Hidden costs
```

## Pricing Strategies

### Fixed Price

```
When to Use:
- Well-defined scope
- Repeatable work
- Client wants budget certainty

Example:
"Website redesign: $25,000
- 5 page designs
- Responsive development
- 2 rounds of revisions
- 8-week timeline"

Pros: Predictable revenue, client certainty
Cons: Risk of scope creep, underestimation
```

### Time & Materials (T&M)

```
When to Use:
- Evolving requirements
- Research/discovery work
- Long-term engagements

Example:
"Hourly rate: $150/hour
Estimated: 100-150 hours
Monthly cap: $20,000
Billed weekly"

Pros: Flexible, low risk for vendor
Cons: Unpredictable cost for client
```

### Retainer

```
When to Use:
- Ongoing relationship
- Predictable monthly work
- Maintenance and support

Example:
"Monthly retainer: $10,000
- 60 hours included
- Rollover up to 20 hours
- Additional hours: $175/hour
- 3-month minimum commitment"

Pros: Predictable income, client priority
Cons: Scope management needed
```

### Value-Based

```
When to Use:
- High-impact deliverables
- Measurable ROI
- Strategic projects

Example:
"Project fee: $100,000
Expected value: $500,000 annual savings
ROI: 5x in first year"

Pros: Higher margins, aligned incentives
Cons: Requires deep understanding, harder to sell
```

## Scope Management

### Change Request Process

```markdown
# Change Request Form

**CR Number:** CR-001
**Date:** [Date]
**Requested By:** [Name]

## Change Description
[Detailed description of requested change]

## Business Justification
[Why this change is needed]

## Impact Assessment

**Timeline Impact:** +2 weeks
**Cost Impact:** +$5,000
**Resource Impact:** Requires additional designer

## Recommendation
☐ Approve
☐ Defer to Phase 2
☐ Reject

**Approved By:** _______________
**Date:** _______________
```

### Preventing Scope Creep

```
1. Document everything in writing
2. Define "done" clearly
3. Use change request process
4. Regular scope reviews
5. Client education on impact
6. Buffer time for unknowns (15-20%)

Red Flags:
- "While you're at it, can you also..."
- "This is a small change..."
- "I thought this was included..."
- Verbal agreements without documentation
```
